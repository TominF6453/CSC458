# CSC458 - Networks
Two assignments with the second building off the first, building a functional virtual router. 

First was a simple router which handled three connections, one client and two HTTP servers. Handled pinging, traceroutes, and file transfer from server to client.

Second was to add NAT functionality to the previous assignment, handling ICMP, TCP and UDP packets. The network map would also need to be built and maintained as the server started without knowing anything about the network.
